# Problem Statement:
ABC Store is facing challenges in understanding and analyzing its sales trend. The current lack of visibility into the sales data hinders the business's ability to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to drive growth. Without a comprehensive understanding of the sales trend, ABC Store struggles to identify patterns, anticipate customer demand, optimize inventory, and tailor marketing strategies effectively. As a result, the business is unable to capitalize on potential growth opportunities and achieve its revenue goals. To overcome these obstacles, ABC Store recognizes the need to implement a solution that provides a clear and insightful view of the sales trend, enabling data-driven decision-making and facilitating strategic actions to increase revenue and improve overall performance.

# Solution Approach:
To address the problem statement, the following approach was used:

# * Data Import and Initial Analysis:
The sales data was provided in a CSV file was imported. Initial insights were drawn from the data to gain a preliminary understanding of the sales trend.

# * Data Modeling and Relationship Creation:
Data modeling was performed within Power BI to create relationships between the relevant tables. This step ensured that the data could be properly analyzed and visualized.

# * Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Power BI's data transformation features, such as Power Query, were utilized to clean and transform the data. Irrelevant entries, duplicates, and inconsistencies were removed or resolved, ensuring the data was accurate and reliable. Also some new colums were introduced for simplification of data.

# * Dashboard Creation:
The created dashboard shows fields like 'Total Order Value', 'Total Order Quantity', 'Total Profit', 'Average Order Value'.
It also shows 'Profit by month', 'Profit by states', 'Profit by sub-category', 'Mode of payment', 'Order quantities by category' and 'Top customers'.
We can also view the data by selecting different quarters of the year.
Also we can select specific states to view statewise data.
By pressing ctrl we can select multiple quarters and multiple states from the selection slicer to view data.

The dashboard was designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter and drill down into specific dimensions or time periods of interest.
